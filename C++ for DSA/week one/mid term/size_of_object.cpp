/*
$$ The size of an object that is allocated to memory depends on ::

>> Type of the objects;

>> The  amount of data that is stored in the object ;

for Example:

if an array nmaed int a[100];
the size will be about 400.

Because In most systems, the size of an int is typically 4 bytes.
Therefore, for an array of 100 int elements, the memory required would be:

100 elements * 4 bytes/element = 400 bytes
